Lane Matters
======

## Purpose
This is an application to track more in-depth League of Legends ranked stats than the standard lookup tool. An emphasis has been placed on the lane phase because the outcome of the 1v1/2v2 with one's counterpart gives better qualitative judgments about players' overall strengths and habits and endgame stats. This is a WIP and presently the minimum viable product.
